GLOBAL DESIGN RULES USED
Conversion scaling pattern used:
1000 → 2500 → 5000 → 10000 → 25000

Building costs scale using:
Base cost × 1.6 per tier
Cross-chain requirements start at tier 3+ to encourage system interaction.

Resource chain buildings act like resources that take a lower resource and convert them, when clicked into a higher chain resource. Clicking or tapping the building converts the resource. Managers can be assigned to the buildings to auto click the building and convert resources when available.

Each resource chain should have its one container to tap to gain the resource. There should be 4 empty manager spots. A tab should be added as access to each new resource in that chain becomes available. That tab switches the resource and tapping and manager slots now are for that resource.
When a building that unlocks a new resource is built a css popup should saying that the resource is now available to the player.
